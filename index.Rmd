# Introduction {#intro}

## Overview {.objectives}

**Questions**

Using data from the California Coastal Poll:

- What are attitudes towards climate change?
- How can I visualize this?
- How can I share results online?

**Objectives**

- Use **RStudio** to code in **R**.
- Read data from an Excel spreadsheet into R (using R package `readxl`).
- Summarize data (using `dplyr`).
- Visualize data (using `ggplot2`).
- Version files with **git**.
- Share results online with **Github**.

## Prerequisites {.prereq}

**R Skill Level**: Beginner -- you can be completely new to R, RStudio, git and Github. This will give you a flavor for how they work.

### Install software

1.This workshop will require the following software installed on your machine:

- [**git**](https://git-scm.com): version control 
- [**R**](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/): statistical programming language
- [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download): integrated development environment

Please download the appropriate stable release for your operating system.

### Create Github login

Create **Github** account at <http://github.com>, if you don't already have one. For username, I recommend all lower-case letters, short as you can. Ideally the username that prefixes your csuci.edu email is available. If you use an email ending in `.edu`, you can request free private repositories through [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).

Be sure to keep track of your username and password, referred to as `USER` and `PASSWORD` throughout the rest of this tutorial, to be replaced by YOUR username and password.

## Launch RStudio

RStudio is as it is an integrated development environment (IDE) for editing text in the code editor, running commands in the R console, viewing defined objects in the workspace and past commands in the history, and viewing plots, files and help. Here's a layout of the panes in RStudio, each of which can have several tabs for alternate functionality:

For a quick overview of the RStudio interface, check out the menu Help > Cheatsheets > [RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).

We'll use RStudio shortly, but first let's create a repository in Github for synchronizing file versioning and publication of results online.
